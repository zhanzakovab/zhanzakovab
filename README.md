## 📂 Projects  

### [🎓 AI-Generated Feedback QA Pipeline](https://github.com/zhanzakovab/QA_Pipeline_Keath.AI)
- Designed and delivered KEATH.AI’s first **LLM QA pipeline**, automating evaluation of **10K+ outputs** with DeepEval (G-Eval) + GPT-4o in Python.
- Built preprocessing workflows and **Judge LLM prompts** (CoT, persona, few-shot), validating improvements through **A/B testing**.
- Established **baseline KPIs**, reframing feedback quality as a **trackable product metric** and surfacing systematic bias against lower-scoring students.

### [🤖 EmotiTask (iOS AI App)](https://github.com/zhanzakovab/emotiTask)  
- Engineered a **full-stack iOS productivity app** with **SwiftUI** + **FastAPI backend**.
- Integrated **OpenAI API** for MBTI-driven task recommendations and **Supabase** for authentication and data storage.

### [🗨️ NLP Tutor Quizbot](https://github.com/zhanzakovab/NLPQuizbot)
- Built a **gamified learning assistant** using Gemini 1.5 (generation) + Claude 3.5 (evaluation).
- Delivered validated, real-time quiz feedback and improved pedagogical relevance with role-based and few-shot prompting. 

### [💬 Sentiment Analysis of Dating App Reviews](https://github.com/zhanzakovab/Sentiment-Analysis-of-Dating-Apps-Reviews)  
- Processed **600k+ reviews** with TF-IDF, VADER, and Word2Vec  
- Benchmarked classifiers (LogReg, SVM, Naive Bayes, FFNN), tuning FFNN to reduce overfitting and improve generalisation.

### 🚲 Data-Driven Optimization for Seoul Public Bike System  
- Forecasted demand with **Random Forest (93.3% accuracy)** for Seoul’s bike-sharing system.
- Applied **scenario and risk analysis**, projecting a **12% efficiency gain** in resource allocation.
